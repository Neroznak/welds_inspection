# welds_inspection
Absolutely all welds in production must be visually inspected during quality control, this is a mandatory requirement of the regulatory authorities. This task is performed by experienced specialists and their classification accuracy is close to 95%. However, in a large production plant, the number of seams produced per day can be measured in thousands. Manual visual inspection can be very time-consuming for highly skilled technicians. To optimize their time, I have to write a program that can classify defective and quality welds from the weld image. In addition, it is important for production to classify defective welds according to the type of defect in order to set up welding machines correctly. Images of the welds are taken during welding, 2 frames per second. The main requirement for the model is to minimize the errors of the first kind (the model recognizes the defective weld as a quality weld), and the prediction speed should be faster than 0.5 seconds. Then, it will be possible to get the value of frames, which the model should get for each seam, in order to nullify the error of the first kind.
